                        appreciation for cars ever since I was a kid. Watching all of the Fast and the Furious movies, Initial D and any movie or show that has fast cars and skilled driving in it.</p></li>
                        <li id="martial"> Martial Artist<p> I didn't start martial arts until I turned 25. That sport was always an interest of mine since I was very involved playing sports on teams. My competative nature was a driving force that lead me to become skilled at an intermediate level in Kickboxing. I fought in a tournament for my dojo called "Contest of Champions" that took place in December of 2021</p></li>
                        <li id="game">Gamer<p>I consider myself to be an unofficial pro at gaming. I've been playing videos games since I was a kid 
                            and didn't become competative until I got into highschool. Me and a good friend of mine started a team playing this game called Paladins and we were semi pro contesting other teams in tournaments.
                            Towards the end of my competative career in Paladins, most of the player base at the highest level knew who we were.</p><p>(By the end of these descriptions you can click anywhere to close box.)</p>
